# LeetCode TypeScript Solutions Repository

Welcome to the LeetCode TypeScript Solutions Repository! This repository contains a collection of my solved LeetCode challenges, all implemented in TypeScript. LeetCode is a popular platform that offers a wide range of coding problems to sharpen your algorithmic skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific LeetCode challenge. Inside each challenge folder, you'll find the TypeScript solution file along with a README file providing detailed explanations and insights into the problem and solution approach.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:`git clone https://github.com/ab-etemadi/leetcode-challenges.git`

2. Navigate to the specific challenge folder you're interested in.

3. Open the TypeScript solution file in your preferred code editor.

4. Read the README file for the challenge, which provides a problem description, solution approach, time and space complexity analysis, and any additional notes or insights.

5. Study the TypeScript code and understand the logic and implementation of the solution.

6. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different approaches, or optimize the solution further.

7. Run the code and test it against various test cases to verify its correctness.

8. Repeat the process for other challenges in the repository as desired.
